# Rumble

Getting started: you will find a Jupyter notebook that introduces the JSONiq language on top of
Rumble [here](https://github.com/ghislainfourny/jsoniq-tutorial). You can use it by installing the all-in-one Data
Science platform [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), unless you prefer to install Python+Spark+PySpark+Jupyter
manually (brew, apt...).

The documentation also contains an introduction specific to Rumble and how you can read input datasets, but we have not
converted it to Jupyter notebooks yet (this will follow).

[The documentation of the latest official release is available here.](http://rumble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[The documentation of the current master (for the adventurous and curious) is available here.](http://sparksoniq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## DecimalGamma

This branch contains changes to experimentally use the DecimalGamma encoding to encode values when ordering or grouping.
To download the DecimalGamma dependency, some steps might be necessary as
outlined [here](https://github.com/RumbleDB/decimalgamma-java#consume-jars).
